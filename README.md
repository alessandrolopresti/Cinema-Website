# Cinema-Website

## Description 

It is a client-side website that groups a series of cinemas and allows, through the form, the booking of tickets and related seats for watching movies.
Like other booking sites, "JustCinema" facilitates customers in choosing the right screening room based on their needs.

The main page shows the list of cinemas that have "joined" the JustCinema chain. By selecting one of those available, it will be possible to view which films are present in order to book and pay for tickets.

There is a section dedicated to the choice of foods and drinks and their description (e.g. family-sized menus etc.).

As a real client oriented application, JustCinema offers a support section for any comments, advice and reviews to improve the website feedback.
